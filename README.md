CS-305 Software Security 8-1 Journal: Security Portfolio

For this task, I assumed the role of a developer at Global Rain, a software firm specializing in tailored software solutions for entrepreneurs, businesses, and global government agencies. At the core of Global Rain's mission is the belief that "Security is everyone's responsibility." Our assignment involved collaborating with Artemis Financial to modernize its operations and implement cutting-edge software security measures. Artemis Financial, equipped with a RESTful web application programming interface (API), sought Global Rain's expertise to reinforce its defenses against external threats.

Reflecting on this undertaking, I recognize the inherent challenges posed by the ever-evolving landscape of online security. Striking a balance between robust security in all transactions and communications is critical for any business, particularly financial institutions like Artemis Financial. Safeguarding customer/client data, company information, and intellectual property remains a top priority. Given Artemis Financial's focus on crafting individualized financial plans, ensuring the security of every communication involving customer accounts, including usernames, passwords, and bank account details, is imperative.

In formulating an approach to enhance Artemis Financial's system security, my focus zeroed in on key components within the code. Prioritizing code quality, with an emphasis on readability, and implementing secure coding practices—such as robust code sanitization, effective exception handling, and error checks—played a pivotal role. Cryptography was instrumental in ensuring proper encryption, preventing compromises to the integrity and confidentiality of transmitted information over the internet. Securing the communication link between the customer (client) and the backend of the web application (server) for financial transactions took precedence, as did fortifying the API configuration to prevent any compromise in the system-to-API connection.

To maintain secure and up-to-date dependencies, I recommended the integration of a dependency-check plugin scanner into our code. This non-intrusive testing method emerged as an effective strategy to ensure code security and the currency of all dependencies. The importance of keeping dependencies updated was underscored, as outdated ones can potentially compromise the security of the application.
